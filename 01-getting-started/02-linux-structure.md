(a) Hardware Layer

ðŸ”¹ The physical components of the computer (CPU, RAM, disk, network interfaces, etc.).
ðŸ”¹ The OS interacts with hardware using device drivers.

(b) Kernel (Core of Linux OS)   (Engine of the Car)

ðŸ”¹ The Linux Kernel is responsible for directly managing system resources, including:

    Process Management â€“ Schedules processes and handles multitasking.

    Memory Management â€“ Allocates and deallocates RAM efficiently.

    Device Drivers â€“ Acts as an interface between software and hardware.

    File System Management â€“ Manages how data is stored and retrieved.

    Network Management â€“ Handles communication between systems.

(c) Shell (Command Line Interface - CLI)

ðŸ”¹ A command interpreter that allows users to interact with the kernel.
ðŸ”¹ Examples: Bash, Zsh, Fish, Dash, Ksh.
ðŸ”¹ Converts user commands into system calls for the kernel.

(d) User Applications

ðŸ”¹ End-user programs like web browsers, text editors, DevOps tools, etc.
ðŸ”¹ Applications interact with the OS using system calls via the shell or GUI.
