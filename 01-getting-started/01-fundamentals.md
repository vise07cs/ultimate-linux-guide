Operating system is an intermediary between the user and the computer hardware and software

1960 --> unix (open source)
1970 --> minix(not open source)
1980 --> MS windows ( GUI)
1990s --> Linux --> Linus Torvalds (open source OS )
2025--> 90% of production is still done on Linux


# Linux over Windows
